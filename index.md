## Bootcamp Blog Week 1

###### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

My first week was pretty much what I expected. I knew it would be information heavy, as most first few weeks of school are. I also figured that with this being a 16-week program there wouldn't really be a point in time that we're just easing into information. One thing I don't think I was quite expecting though was the world of git. Being someone who has not had any experience with the program prior to bootcamp, it is definitely slightly intimidating. 

###### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I am excited to see my knowledge just grow in general. Starting out, git has me excited since it's not something I have used before. I am excited to go more in depth with gitpod so I can have a better understnading of the program. 

###### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

My birthday is this coming Monday, Augsust 28, which also happens to be my parent's wedding 36th anniversary.

## Bootcamp Blog Week 2

###### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

I'll be honest and say I have too many things that I wish I could do but don't have the coding skills to accomplish. If I were to try to lock that down to one thing, I feel like it’s still pretty broad: I would like to create a functional site that is also aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. 

###### What are you struggling with?

At this time, the thing I am most struggling with it motivation and procrastination with the work I want to get done. Part of me feels that if/when I set up my workspace to be what I want it might help, but that also takes time and the motivation part, that’s the struggle. 

###### How do you solve a problem? 

When I solve a problem, I try really hard to solve it on my own. I feel like when that happens I have an easier time remembering it. I think back to math classes when I took them, if I worked through it before asking for help then I could remember the problem when it came time to take a test on it. Though I am not above asking for help when I know I need it, but sometimes I do like to work through the struggle first. 

###### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

In regards to coding, I try to look up similar solutions or through the material I have saved to see if there is an answer hidden somewhere that can help get me unstuck. When all else fails, I reach out for help. Coding is a topic that I don’t know a lot about, but am eager to learn. I also know that I have people around me, in this bootcamp and in my personal life, that can help me find a solution.
