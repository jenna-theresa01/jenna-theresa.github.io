## Bootcamp Blog Week 1

###### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

My first week was pretty much what I expected. I knew it would be information heavy, as most first few weeks of school are. I also figured that with this being a 16-week program there wouldn't really be a point in time that we're just easing into information. One thing I don't think I was quite expecting though was the world of git. Being someone who has not had any experience with the program prior to bootcamp, it is definitely slightly intimidating. 

##### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I am excited to see my knowledge just grow in general. Starting out, git has me excited since it's not something I have used before. I am excited to go more in depth with gitpod so I can have a better understnading of the program. 

##### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

My birthday is this coming Monday, Augsust 28, which also happens to be my parent's wedding 36th anniversary.
